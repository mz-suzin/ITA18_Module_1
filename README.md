# ITA18_Module_1
My DELL IT Academy module 1 - C#

My book of knowledge:


C# is a programming language;
.NET is a framework for building applications on windows.

.NET is composed of two components:
CLR -> Common Language Runtime;
Class Library.

CLR:
When a C# code is compiled, it is compiled into IL Code (Intermediate Language), something like ByteCode for Java and JavaScript.
CLR then comes to action by transforming IL Code into Native Code. CLR Is a JIT Compiler that compiles the code into the native code for the machine it is being run.

C#:
The language builds applications. 
Applications consists of Classes. As many of those as you want.
A class is made of 
1. Data (also called attributes) -> Ex.: A class 'car' has data of: make, model, color...
2. Methods (also called functions) -> Ex.: The same class 'car' has methods of start() and move();

As the name of classes grows, we use namespaces for related classes. So we can keep the code organised.
We will also need an Assembly (DLL (dynamically linked librarie) or EXE). It is a container for related namespaces. It's a file on the disk.
